## Automatic variables   
- Variables that are declared inside the functions with the keyword auto are called automatic variables. The local variable's scope is inside the function in which it is declared.   
 
## Global variables    
- Variables declared outside the functions with the keyword global are called global variables. Global variables can be accessed by multiple functions defined in the program.

## Extern variables   
External variables share the variables among the multiple C files. The extern keyword is used in the C programming language to declare external variables.   

## Static local variables
- These variables outlive their scope, inside the function, when the function is called again they retain their old values

## Static global variables
- Variables declared as static globally are accessible within that file only and cannot be accessible outside the file

## Register variables
