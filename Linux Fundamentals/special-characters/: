# null command [colon]. 
# This is the shell equivalent of a "NOP" (no op, a do-nothing operation). 
# It may be considered a synonym for the shell builtin true. 
# The ":" command is itself a Bash builtin, and its exit status is true (0).

:
echo $?   # 0


while :
do
   operation-1
   operation-2
   ...
   operation-n
done

# Same as:
#    while true
#    do
#      ...
#    done
