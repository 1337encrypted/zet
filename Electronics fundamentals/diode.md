- A dioide is a semiconductor device which allows current to flow in one direction

- 1s2, 2s2 2p6, 3s2 3p2 therefore 4 valence electronics in the outermost shell.

- Now silicon having 4 outer electrons is unstable and to attain stability it need 4 more electrons to reach the configuration of the next noble gas.    
- So it form covalent bonds with neighbouring silicon atoms. **Colvelent bonds** are pair of electrons shared between two atoms.

- Its very hard to add another electron to this group of stable atoms

- Therefore silicon is doped with trivalent and pentavalent impurities, doping either adds 1 electron such as in the case of pentavalent and trivalent removes an electron from making the structure deficinet of one electron
- If more electrons are present due to pentavalent doping then its considered as a N - type semiconductor.   
- If electrons are deficient due to trivalent doping then it is considered as P - type semiconductor.
