# Liskov Substitution

- Introduced by Barbara Liskov state that "objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program"

- If a program module is using a Base class, then the reference to the Base class can be replaced with a Derived class without affecting the functionality of the program module

- We can also state that Derived types must be substitutable for their base types
