  6d. Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children for children (6 years and younger) or seniors (65 years and older).
  - Create a variable 'age' and save a person's age inside
  - Create an if-statement that check if the person qualifies for a discount. if they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise, display 'No discount' in the console.
  Note: try to use the || operator in your solution.
  - Try changing the 'age' variable to display different messagess.
