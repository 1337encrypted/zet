## mkdir – Create Directories

The mkdir command is used to create directories. It works like this:    

`$ mkdir dir1`  

would create a single directory named dir1, while the following:   

`$ mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3`    

would create three directories named dir1, dir2, and dir3.   

## cp – Copy Files and Directories

The cp command copies files or directories. It can be used two different ways. The following:   

`$ cp item1 item2`   

copies the single file or directory item1 to the file or directory item2 and the following:   

`$ cp item... directory`   

copies multiple items (either files or directories) into a directory.   

| Option |   Long Option  | Meaning |
| :----: |   :--------    | :------ |
| `-a` | <pre>--archive</pre> | Copy files and directories and all their attributes, including ownerships and permissions. Normally copy takes on default attributes of the user performing the copy. |
| `-i` | <pre>--interactive</pre> | Before overwriting an existing file prompt the user for confirmation. If this option is not specified cp will silently overwrite the files. |
| `-r` | <pre>--recursive</pre> | Recursively copy directories and and their contents. This option (or the -a option) is required when copying directories. |
| `-u` | <pre>--update</pre> | When copying files from one directory to another, only copy files that either don't exist or are newer than the existing corresponding files, in the destination directory. This is used while copying large number of files as it skips files that are already been copied. |
| `-v` | <pre>--verbose</pre> | Display informative message while copy is being performed. |

## cp Examples

| Command | Result |
| :-- | :-- |
|`cp file1 file2` | Copy file1 to file2, **if file2 exists it is overwritten with the contents of file1.** if it doesn't exist then its created. |
|`cp -i file1 file2`| If file 2 exists the user is prompted before its overwritten. |
|`cp file1 file2 dir1`| Copy file1 and file2 into directory dir1. The directory dir1 must already exist.|
|`cp dir1/* dir2` | Copy all the contents of directory dir1 in directory dir2, only if directory dir2 exists. |
| `cp -r dir1 dir2` | Copy all the contents of dir1 recursively in dir2. If dir2 doesn't exist then create it and copy the files |

## mv – Move and Rename Files   

The mv command performs both file moving and file renaming   

`mv item1 item2`   

to move or rename the file or directory item1 to item2 or:   

`mv item... directory`   

to move one or more items from one directory to another.
